Hi Nicholas<br>We enjoyed the tour of Rhodes very much. Thanks for showing us around your special island home. I've just this morning unpacked the pottery and they survived unscathed. No breakages thank goodness. If we come back to Rhodes, we'll be sure to look you up again.  Thank once again. Regards Marilyn and Peter (Nov 25th) Seattle, Washington

My mom and I booked an all-day tour, which included the "Best of Rhodes" highlights and a fabulous lunch at a traditional restaurant before making our way back across the island on a wonderful scenic route. Our private tour was the highlight of our trip, and I would not hesitate to book again with Nicholas. It was a comfortable, enjoyable experience from start to finish and we were valued as people and treated as close friends, ...so I am saving now for my next visit! Thank you Margaret G (Oct 20th) Boston, Mass.

Hi Nicholas and Mike, Thank you for your services. Mike gave us a wonderful tour of Rhodes, and we had a great time and learned a lot about this beautiful island.  All the best, Sally (Aug 16th) Wollongong AU

Thanks Nicholas. We very much enjoyed our tour with Stathis and will recommend your service (and Stathis) to our friends and on TripAdvisor.  Stathis was just the right guide for us, allowing plenty of time to look at the sites and his information on Rhodes was very interesting. We also enjoyed eating lunch at the restaurant that he recommended.  We hope you have a great year ahead. Best Wishes  Mike and Barbara (Aug 4th) Sydney, Australia

You were able to customize it to meet our needs and limitations. You obviously have a great knowledge and love of/for Rhodes and we would love to tour with you if we are ever back. There is a lot more to see in Rhodes. Regards, Rosa (May 3rd) New York USA
