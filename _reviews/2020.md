Dear Nicholas, Thank you for having us and please thank Michael. He was absolutely wonderful and so informative.  Stay safe and thank you for a wonderful holiday experience.<br>

Hopefully once things settle down again around the world and our borders in NZ reopen, we can start planning again. We will definitely be booking this tour with you again. In the meantime, please stay safe. We look forward to seeing you in the future.<br>
Blessing to you and your team<br>

Hi Nicholas. Thank you for your service. We had a wonderful tour with Michael, was very friendly and gave us some interesting titbits about the life in Rhodes. We will definitely be back!<br>
