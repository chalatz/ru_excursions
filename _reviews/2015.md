Dear Nicholas, it was our first visit to Rhodes and we are more convinced about here beauties and rich history as before, but mainly thanks to the professional knowledge, the clear and informative presentation on a pleasant and humoristic way by your brother Michael. Thanks very much. Gerrit (Nov 27th) Washington, DC

Hi Nicholas, our experience with you, your drivers and your lovely island were a highlight of our cruise. Thank you very much for taking such good care of us. Our lunch stop was perfect. We will all recommend you to our friends. Paula (Nov 2nd) Prince Edward Island Canada

Thanks Nicholas. We enjoyed the tour and appreciated your great care of our group. Regards, Ron (Nov 1st) Fresno, California

Hi Nicholas, thank you we had a great time. Your drivers were great looked after as well, always driving safely and informative. Dion (Oct 13th) Nunavut Canada

Nicholas, I just wanted to say Thanks - we had a great day in Rhodes. All three drivers were fantastic! We all appreciated seeing your cars there when we got off the ship, and they brought all of us back with no issues. Thanks, Brian (Oct 14th) Los Angeles

Thank you, Nicholas, - we had a great time with Dominic. We will certainly recommend your tours. Of all the islands we visited, my wife and I both agree that Rhodes is the one we would love to come back to for an extended stay. All the best, Doug and Ramona (Oct 10th) New Brunswick Canada

Hi Nicholas, thank you for your great service and educational narration in showing us Rhodes, I will get my other friend to contact you as they will be visiting Rhodes next year in April on cruise too. Thanks again for everything. Marie W. (Oct 2nd) Quebec Canada

Dear Nicholas, we have only just returned home after a wonderful trip to Turkey & Greece. One of the highlights we had was seeing the lovely island of Rhodes and although it would still have been beautiful, the tour we did with Yannis, made it all the more special. He brought new ideas and thoughts to our discussions and we found that very interesting - not just a 'tour driver'.  If any of our friends, which some do, are going to Rhodes, we will be more than happy to recommend your services to them.  Thank you again and we will remember Rhodes with much fondness. Regards Gayle H. (Sept 23rd) Long Beach, Calif.

Nicholas, we enjoyed ourselves very much and Yannis was wonderful. You have a beautiful country and island. We hope to come back! Sincerely, Pam (Sept 20th) Ontario Canada

Hi Nicholas, we just returned home yesterday. We had a great time in Rhodes and we enjoyed the tour with Michael and thanks to him, we took the donkey ride to Acropolis of Lindos, which my son had a kick out of it:)) In a few days Iâ€™ll try to get on Trip advisor and review the tour, this way other travelers find out about you and the good services you have to offer.  Regards, Marcela (Sept 4th) UK

Dear Nicholas: You gave Pamela and me a great tour of Rhodes and I'll post a highly favorable review of your services on TripAdvisor. I wish you the very best and please stay in touch. Clif C (Aug 27th) Sunshine Coast AU

Nicholas, my husband and I had the pleasure of taking a tour with Stergos on August. Of all the places we visited on our honeymoon (various throughout Greece & Turkey), we both agreed that Rhodes was our favorite, and a large part of that was because of Stergos and his wonderful tour. We felt so lucky to have had a chance to explore your beautiful island with such a knowledgeable and friendly driver! Thank you!  Kate & George (Aug 19th) New Brunswick Canada

Thank you and best wishes to you and your family, Pamela H (Aug 3rd) Los Angeles, Calif. USA
