  sections:
  - title: What to Know Before You Go...
    items:
    - q: What is meant by "Rhodes Private Tour"?
      a: Each tour booked with us, is for only the individual, couple, or family making
        the reservation.
    - q: Can I bring our kids on a private shore excursion?
      a: We have no age restrictions, so even infants are welcome to join our tours.
    - q: Is it possible to customize a tour to meet our needs?
      a: Absolutely! You may select the parts of our tours that interest you in the
        time that you have.
    - q: Are some excursions limited to specific days of the week?
      a: All excursions may be booked any day of the week, year-round / season-round.
    - q: May we choose where to begin our tour?
      a: Of course! You choose where to start your day-cruise ship, airport, hotel-wherever
        you wish!
    - q: May we choose what time we start?
      a: We will begin your tour at any time, but we usually start at 8:30 am or when
        your cruise ship arrives at the port dock.
    - q: Do you require a minimum number of passengers to book a tour?
      a: No. We will provide a tour to just one person. (Prices are per car not per
        person)
    - q: Will I need special clothing on my shore excursion?
      a: Dress code in Rhodes Island is very casual, for men shorts and T-shirts is
        the norm, and for ladies, light summer dresses or similar to men. If you are
        coming in spring or autumn you should bring some warmer clothes just in case
        it gets a bit cold in the night.
    - q: A "half-day" shore excursion (with sedan car 4 passengers) takes 5:00 hours.
        Why?
      a: Rhodes is the forth biggest island in Greece with an area of 1,408 km<sup>2</sup>
        / 543,6 miles<sup>2</sup>. Our goal is to show you approximately 60% of Rhodes
        highlights in our half day excursions and provide you with personal attention
        from your driver. This cannot be safely done in two or three hours. Our associate
        drivers do not drive fast to cover more kilometers / miles, and they don't
        "skip" sites to make up time. They focus on you enjoying a comfortable tour
        experience.
    - q: Can you accommodate larger groups?
      a: "[Group Shore Excursions in Rhodes](./groups.htm)"
    - q: What is meant by an English-speaking "knowledgeable tour/driver"?
      a: Our associate Knowledgeable tour/drivers are fully licensed to drive a vehicle
        classified as public transportation. They are experienced chauffeurs with
        a great knowledge of the island's culture, and traditions. While English speaking
        drivers are fairly common in most cities, knowledgeable tour/drivers aren't
        as easy to find. They are educated gentleman and professionally trained to
        ensure that you get out of your excursion whatever you are looking for in
        the way of local color, culture, fun, and historical sights. They will give
        you information, as well as connections in time, and places that will make
        your visit more meaningful.
    - q: When do you need a knowledgeable tour/driver?
      a: A knowledgeable tour/driver is ideal for you if you are visiting Rhodes Island
        for a short time. Or you are on a cruise and you need to see as many sites
        as possible in half or full-day. A knowledgeable tour/driver can customize
        an itinerary for you combining good fun and eye-opening experiences.<br>**Attention:**
        Please note that by law in Greece and in most of EU countries knowledgeable
        tour/drivers are not allowed to accompany walking clients into archaeological
        sites.
    - q: Do I need a licensed tour guide?
      a: If you need a separate licensed tour guide, we can arrange it for an additional
        cost.<br>**Attention:** Please note that by law in Greece and in most of EU
        countries tour guides cannot provide chauffeur service.
    - q: Is a payment required at the time we make our reservation?
      a: No, we don't need prepayment. Book now and pay later.
    - q: May we finalize our booking via email?
      a: Yes, we finalize arrangements via email.
    - q: How will find our driver / guide at the port?
      a: Your driver will meet you at the pier/ dock. When we finalize the tour booking,
        we'll give you all the meeting details.
  - title: As We Travel Down the Roadâ€¦
    items:
    - q: How much time will we have at each stop?
      a: There is, of course, more to see at some sites than others, and we want you
        to have plenty of time to take photos at each landmark. We do not have time
        limits for the sites, but we do watch how we progress through each stop and
        make adjustments accordingly.
    - q: What happens if I decide I want more time on the tour?
      a: We take more time! If you use a sedan car you may extend a tour (on the Go)
        as long as you wish. No extensions for minibuses and coaches.
    - q: What if we need to make a W.C. stop?
      a: There are facilities available along the way if one should need a W.C.
    - q: What happens if we run into bad weather?
      a: Excursions take place no matter the weather-in our Mediterranean climate,
        with more than 300 days of sun per year, weather isn't an issue. Tours may
        not be cancelled at the last minute.
    - q: What happens if my private shore excursion doesn't make it back to the cruise
        ship on time?
      a: We've never had such an unfortunate accidence over the last 35 years we have
        been offering private shore excursions.<br>For more information please visit
        [Back to the Ship on Time](./worry_free.htm)
    - q: If we wish to end the shore excursion at the Medieval City and walk back
        to our cruise ship, how long will it take to travel from the gate near the
        Palace of the Grand Master and the Archaeological Museum?
      a: Most people can make the walk in 10 - 15 minutes, but if you want to take
        longer and enjoy the walk-through Old Town, we will leave enough time for
        you to do so.
    - q: Should I tip my driver / guide?
      a: It is never an obligation to tip; it is just a way to reward good service.<br>General
        tipping etiquette 10-20% in private tours and personalized services.
