### Cruise Ships Visiting Rhodes Greece

The prime cruising season in Rhodes is May to October, with May, June, September and October being the busiest months.

It gets quite hot in the middle of summer, so some cruise lines reposition their ships to northern Europe at that time and concentrate in the Med during May and early June, and then again in September through October and November.

Some cruise lines offer discount cruise packages to Greek Isles at the beginning and at the end of the season March and November. For the European charter flights (not the cruise ships) busiest and hottest months are July and August.

The cruise terminal located in the center of the harbor, opposite to the ferry terminal. Rhodes is a dock port, no tender, so it's easy to disembark.
