### Back to the ship in time

Enjoy a Worry-Free shore excursion in Rhodes Island with our detailed arrangements from the beginning to the end.

We guarantee that we will take you back to the ship in time for departure. We have not been late to any ship - ever

Our associate fleet of cars is maintained and kept in quality condition. In the unlikely event of mechanical failure, we will resolve the matter within 10 - 20 minutes. As we corporate with the biggest transfers companies on the island a simple phone call ensures that your tour will not be disrupted and that you are safely returned to your ship in time for departure. Bon Voyage!

We don’t require booking deposit or prepayment for private excursions by sedan cars. If weather conditions or other reasons cause your cruise ship to change its itinerary and not arrive in port, we lose the job, but you don’t lose money.

If the ship arrives late into port, we’ll adjust our schedules, and the rental time will start from the moment you meet your driver-without you losing time and money.

### Shore Excursion Safety

#### Your safety is of the utmost importance to us.

Our excursions are conducted only by our associate licensed, experienced professional chauffeurs / drivers. Our experience allows us to drive you with precision and care, and we ensure that you make the most of your short visit on Rhodes Island. We carry cellular phones and radios for constant communication. In addition to being at your service for the duration, your driver will be courteous and knowledgeable to make your excursion with us memorable.

Our fleet is consistently maintained, inspected, and updated for your safety and comfort. Our cars are all comfortable, air-conditioned luxury vehicles which are equipped with a wide variety of safety features and are fully insured. These Mercedes Benz Sedan Limos hold 4 passengers comfortably, plus the driver.

### Shore Excursion Flexibility:

#### Our service is the best way to enhance your cruise experience while off the ship.

Planning your own shore excursion means going where you want to go!! We offer fully-customizable shore excursions to suit your special needs, including no strenuous walking or climbing for people with physical limitations. You can change or extend the itinerary in advance (or on the go) of your private shore excursion as you wish. You may also add attractions or plan your own small group shore excursion: consider, for example, scenic shore excursions, cultural shore excursions, or water sports excursions.

If you like, you can extend your half day excursion and add lunch time at a seaside village, right on the water’s edge, or at a traditional local tavern and taste the Rhodian cuisine and our excellent local wines. We are very flexible and we design the excursions according to your wishes…
