#### Experience

We have dedicated ourselves to providing customized tours for private groups for over 30 years. We have accommodated small groups in our Mercedes Benz sedan cars. As larger groups, have become interested in our services, we provide Luxury Mercedes Benz Minibuses driven by Professional Drivers and hosted by Licensed Tour Guides (required by Greek law). The minibuses will be for the exclusive use of your group. No strangers in the mix - just your family and friends. The local tour guides are knowledgeable and skilled at revealing the history and beauty of each place that you visit. But underneath that knowledge is their ability to customize your tour so that every wish is fulfilled within the limits of your schedule.

#### Flexibility

We provide the opportunity to be flexible with your itinerary. Every group is different and we are happy to work with those differences. You can select any tour available on our website where we have done all the planning for you. Or, you can give us a list of the places you would like to visit and the activities you would like to do, and we will plan a special tour just for you. In that case, we would put together an itinerary of the sites, the attractions, and the vehicle(s) that would best accommodate your group.      Your group can include seniors, children, shoppers, swimmers and people with different schedules. No problem. We can swap out cars and set up multiple itineraries. That way, everyone can do what they wish. We can keep seniors company while others are touring at a faster pace. We know places that children like to go. We pride ourselves on our flexibility.

#### Simplicity

Simply let us know if you want to take a standard tour or if you have a list of special things in mind. Then let us know how many people are in your group. We will modify any tour to meet your needs and schedule the best vehicle or combination of vehicles to accommodate your group size and maximize your short time on the island. It couldn't be easier.

Whichever way you choose to plan, and whatever size group you have, we will create an unforgettable trip for you. Take advantage of our 37 years of experience and creativity. We know this island inside and out, and would be delighted to discuss your requirements. Let us design a tour that is perfect for your group (large or small). Turn over the hard work to us and then sit back and enjoy this wonderful place you have come to visit. Feel free to contact us and we will do the rest.
