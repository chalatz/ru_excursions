    Nicholas A. Rhodes was born in Egypt, Alexandria. His parents were Greek, from the big "Greek Community of Alexandria".

    After he graduated from high school, he continued his education as a programming and systems designer while his brother Michael was finishing at the Tourism College in Cairo. After graduating, both brothers moved to Athens for few years and eventually settled on the beautiful island of Rhodes where they became involved with the ever-growing tourism industry. Nick found enough time to marry and produce two adorable children - one son and one daughter. Nick and Michael now run a professional and successful private tours business.

    Both Nick and Michael are fluent in Greek, speak and write near-perfect English and Arabic, speak comprehensible Spanish, German, and Italian, and can even manage a bit of French---enough for basic conversation.
