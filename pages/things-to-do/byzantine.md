    During the first Christian period (330-650 A.D.) Rhodes belonged to a part of the Christianized empire called the Byzantine Empire. The Island was a very important military base. As a significant Byzantine trading port, it was also a crossroads for ships sailing between Constantinople and Alexandria.

    The Byzantine fortified walls of Rhodes (7th c. -13th c.) divided the town into two sections:

    A) The Acropolis (later the Palace of the Grand Masters) and therefore the Upper Town which is that the area surrounding the acropolis (later the Collachio).

    B) The Lower Town (later the Burgum). Today parts of this fortification survive mostly within the Collachio, incorporated into later structures. Rhodes city had an excellent number of churches, among them some basilicas of impressive dimensions.
