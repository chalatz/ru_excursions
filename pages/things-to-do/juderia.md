outro: '"La Juderia" the Jewish Quarter of Rhodes Greece'
sections:
- text: The Jewish Community of the Island of Rhodes has a rich history that dates
    back to the second century BC, with the earliest reference to it appearing in
    the book of Maccabees. Other references to the Jewish presence in the Island are
    found in the writings of the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius. The Jews of Rhodes
    like the other Jews living in Greece and in its Islands spoke Greek and conducted
    the religious services in Greek, following the Romaniote rite, which is distinct
    from Sephardi, Ashkenaz, and Italian rites.

- text: 'The Jewish community in Rhodes was most affected within the last 500 years
    by the influx of Jews from Spain, who fled at the time of the Spanish Inquisition.
    Their descendants are referred to as Sephardic Jews, derived from "Sepharad",
    the Hebrew word for Spain. These Jews brought with them their culture, their customs
    and traditions, one amongst the cultural aspects was linguistic, the language
    they spoke was Espanyol, as they called it, also referred to as a Ladino and "Judeo-Spanish".
    The Jewish Quarter of the mediaeval town was affectionately known as **"La Juderia"**. '

- text: At the start of the 20th century, many young Jews left the Island in search
    of higher economic opportunities in America and in Africa. In the early 1920s
    the community had reached its peak population of 4.500 souls. In 1943 Rhodes was
    taken by the Germans, and on July 23 of the subsequent year, 1673 members of the
    Jewish community were arrested and deported to the Auschwitz extermination camp,
    where most of them were slaughtered. Only 151 survived. In 1947 the Island was
    ceded to Greece. Today there are not many of Jews living in Rhodes.
- text: "**The Square of the Jewish Martyrs in Rhodes** (known in Greek as Evreon
    Martyron) is found within the heart of the previous Jewish Quarter. The Square
    was originally a region of Jewish homes and little shops. However, the area was
    bombed during World War II, and in its place was established a tiny little park
    and square. The present fountain ornamented with three seahorses replaced a previous
    fountain that was destroyed during WWII. The Holocaust Memorial was dedicated
    on June 23, 2002, in memory of the World War II victims from the islands of Rhodes
    and Cos."

    the Kahal Shalom is the oldest synagogue in Greece and the sole remaining Jewish
    synagogue on Rhodes still actively holding services. the complete name of the
    building is Kahal Kadosh Shalom (Holy Congregation of Peace). The inside of the
    Kahal Shalom Synagogue follows the standard Sephardic type of having the "tevah"
    (the prayer reading table) within the center of the sanctuary facing southeast
    toward Jerusalem. As a result of a liberalization of religious policy, in 1935
    a balcony was created to be used as a women''s prayer area. Before that point
    the ladies sat within the rooms adjacent to the south wall of the synagogue that
    viewed the sanctuary through curtained openings. Those rooms are converted into
    the Jewish Museum of Rhodes.'

    Angeles and he is a 3rd generation “Rhodesli”. He is an attorney in L.A. where
    he has been practicing immigration law since 1980. He was inspired to go to the
    island of Rhodes in 1975 by stories told to him by his grandparents. Its special
    charm and history fascinated him. Several years later, in 1995, he came back to
    Rhodes together with his family for his children to find out  of their family
    heritage. It was during that visit that he noticed the requirement of advancing
    the general public awareness and appreciation of its unique history unfortunately
    devastated by the Holocaust."

    the person who spearheaded the movement to preserve the vital history of the Jews
    of Rhodes. I respect those trying to keep alive Rhodian history. In 1997, Hasson
    founded the Rhodes Jewish Historical Foundation, a non-profit organization established
    to preserve the unique history and cultural background of the Jews of Rhodes,
    and to function as a link between the past, present and future generations of
    “Rhodeslis” around the world._
- text: "**The Jewish Cemetery.** Originally the Jewish cemeteries were located inside
    the Old City of Rhodes. In the 1930s, the Italian government forced the relocation
    of the cemeteries from the Juderia to an area outside the Old City walls and into
    its present location in the new city . The Jewish Cemetery is one of the best
    preserved in Europe and contains tombstones from the 1500s to the present. It
    is located outside the Old City of Rhodes along the main road towards Kalitheas
    and Faliraki. Excavations of additional tombstones are continuing. During the
    last five years over 300 burial stones have been uncovered."

    lived on Rhodes until WW2. Their culture, which is began in 800 B.C. survives
    as a little émigré community in Los Angeles. Their complex ethnic and spiritual
    heritage is exclusive in the world today. The Rhodesli are Jews who speak an uncommon
    medieval Spanish dialect (Ladino) and detect traditions derived from Turkish,
    Moorish, Spanish, and Jewish sources that remain mostly unchanged from centuries
    past.'
