    One of the highlights of travel is experiencing the culinary delights of a destination, and Rhodes is renowned for its tasty dining.

    The island of Rhodes produces an eclectic array of dishes designed to appeal to the gourmet and would-be gourmet in all of us. Local cuisine has its roots in ancient traditions and uses fresh ingredients to ensure that each dish will appeal to your senses and satiate your appetite.

    Rhodian dishes tend toward the savory side and can trace their roots to Dorian Rhodes. Sophist and rhetorician Athenaeus Nafkratios, notes in his book Deipnosofistai that ancient Rhodians were partial to fish soup and lauded those who "ate fish and not meat". Though meat was added to the menu in medieval times, and dishes include modern twists, traditional preparations and tastes prevail. Fresh vegetables, as well as local olive oils, herbs, and spices such as spearmint, rosemary, oregano, and thyme will tantalize your taste buds!

    When you order your meal, it might be easier if you order by section of the menu. First your appetizers (mezedes), then the main dish and the drinks. Dessert is ordered at the end of the meal.

    **In Fish Restaurant:** If you wish to order **Fresh Fish "Fresko Psari"**, then you ask to see the fish, and also the waiter will take you to the place where the "catch of the day" is displayed, usually within the kitchen.  Thereyou'll be able to inquire about what kind of fish is displayed, the price per kilo (2, 20 pounds) and you order the amount you want to eat. The waiters will give you the cost information and also the cooking details. The Rhodian waiters are very experienced, patient and more than happy to make your lunch a true pleasure (even during the peak season when the island is full of tourists).

  text: 'International studies have recognized the worth of the Greek cuisine. Launched
    within the early 60’s by the World Health Organization, the Seven Countries Study
    taken off to look at the eating patterns of populations from seven different countries:
    Greece, Italy, Serbia, Holland, Finland, the USA and Japan. This long-running
    study which lasted for 30 years showed that that folks living within the Mediterranean
    countries, Greece specifically, had lower mortality rates compared to the remainder
    of the participating countries. The “secretes” to Health and Longevity were documented
    as the combination of a simple - easy diet and regular physical activity, dubbed
    as the Mediterranean Diet.'
