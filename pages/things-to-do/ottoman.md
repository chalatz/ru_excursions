    buildings were constructed: mosques, public baths and mansions for the new patrons.
    After the establishment of their sovereignty on the island, the Ottoman Turks
    converted most of the churches into mosques and transformed the most important
    houses into private mansions or public buildings. '

- text: The 200-year period of the Knights, is reflected in the building facades with
    sculptured decorations, the arched gates and hewn stone walls. The Turks enriched
    these elements with architectural contributions of their own, such as wooden balconies
    and communal fountains and baths which they adapted to the local climate and culture.
    There is currently an effort to preserve the remaining Turkish homes. What remains
    of the Turkish influence on Rhodes can be seen in the mixture of oriental and
    western architecture in Rhodes Town, reflecting the multifaceted history of the
    Island.
