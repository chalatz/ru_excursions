- text: Following the defeat of Turkey in the Italian-Turkish War of 1911, Italian
    troops took over the island of Rhodes, together with the remainder of the Dodecanese
    Islands. In 1923, they established an Italian colony called **Isole Italiane dell'Egeo**
    ("Italian Islands of the Aegean Sea"). Italian dictator **Benito Mussolini** initiated
    a program of "Italianization." it had been designed to force cultural and ethnic
    assimilation of the native minority populations hoping to create in Rhodes a contemporary
    transportation hub that would serve as a focal point for the spread of Italian
    culture in the East. The new Italian buildings reflected the spirit of public
    administration and set new benchmarks within the urban landscape. All these public
    buildings are samples of colonial policy and are closely linked to the presence
    of two general governors, equally active but diametrically opposed in their choices
    in architecture, **Mario Lago** (1924-1936) and **Cesare Maria De Vecchi** (1936-1943).

- text: During the years of the occupation, the Italians administered an in-depth
    program of building and restoration using the almost free local labor force. Among
    other projects, the whole length of the fortification walls was consolidated and
    conserved. They preserved what was left from the Knights' period, skipped most
    Ottoman buildings and removed Ottoman additions that had been made to ecclesiastical
    monuments. They reconstructed the Grand Master's Palace, the Knights' Hospital
    and Filerimos Monastery.

- text: The restoration methods they used are the topic of fierce criticism today.
    Although they were restricted by the political circumstances of their day, they
    nevertheless helped to preserve many sites that otherwise won't have survived
    to this.
