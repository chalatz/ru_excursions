    Lindos and it is called St. Paul’s Bay because people claim that the saint landed
    there in 51 AD to preach Christianity to the Lindians. There is a small church
    there as well which is often used for weddings especially for couples who want
    to get married with the Acropolis of Lindos and the ocean as the backdrop.

    There are actually two beaches there. The larger one is located in the southern end, is the largest and is manmade and the smaller one is located at the north side and formed naturally. That is why the former has fine golden sand and the latter has a mix of pebbles and rocks.

    Like all of the beaches on the island, the beaches in St. Paul’s Bay also offer sun lounges, umbrellas and restaurants that visitors can avail. The difference is that these ones get relatively few visitors and no water sporting equipment. However, you can go snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters.
