    West of the old town) and throbs with life even during offseason.\n\n Modern flats,
    wide streets, squares, modern shops, government offices, hotels, restaurants and
    among all these, an important number of buildings, where the Venetian and Gothic
    elements blend in a neo-colonial and Italianate style.\n \n The new town of Rhodes
    is an extensive, fairly non-descript modern city and one of the most interesting
    and picturesque part of the Island.\n\n - The old **Mandraki harbor**, where according
    to tradition, the **Colossus of Rhodes**, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient
    World, once stood.<br>Two bronze deer statues mark the site, male and female,
    the island's symbols, they stand imperiously at the port's entrance.\n - Close
    to the entrance of the small old harbour stands the **fort of Saint Nicholas**
    and near the fortress three stone **Byzantines Windmills** lend the finishing
    touch to one of the loveliest views of the town."
