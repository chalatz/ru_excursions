    (also known as Kallithea Spa) are the sparkling, healing waters of the Bay of
    Kalithea. The waters sprang from the rocks and have been in existence since the
    age of knights and Doric Hexapolis. Even during that time, people across Asia
    Minor and even as far back as Anatolia visited the spring especially during September.

- text: The spring was not always a tourist hotspot, at least not until 1927 when
    Rhodes was under Italy’s occupation. During that time, doctors and hydrologists
    studying the Kalithea Bay discovered that it had a lot of potential for development.
    The very next year, Pietro Lombardi, the famous architect was commissioned to
    build the Thermal Spa Institution and the original design still stands today after
    almost a century. The spa was inaugurated in 1929 and has since attracted visitors
    and scientists from all across the globe.

- text: "The spa is truly spectacular to behold. The main rotunda boasts an amazing
    dome that stands out because of its unique decorations. The facility contains
    a total of six springs from the same number of fountain heads. A picturesque path
    goes straight to the large rotunda which is surrounded by impressive columns.
    \n\nWhat’s interesting is that those same columns used to support a gorgeous pergola
    back in the day. Today, a cultural monument exists inside the facility which contains
    several paintings and sculptures from island inhabitants.  The Thermal Spa Institution’s
    ideal and beautiful location is well known so it is little wonder why it is sought
    by both tourists and filmmakers. It was the setting of **the movie ‘Escape from
    Athena’ and ‘The Guns of Navarone.**\n\nWith all of these attractions, it is little
    wonder why Kalithea Springs are filled with tourists every year. Besides being
    a tourist attraction, it is also a popular venue for weddings and corporate events.
