- text: Known as the Petaloudes Valley in Greek, the Butterfly Valley is located on
    the western side of Rhodes. What makes it special is that it is home to a diverse
    range of species of Jersey Tiger moths. Every year, colorful moths and butterflies
    cover the land from mid-June to mid-September. They are attracted to the region
    due to highly humid weather conditions. The Oriental Sweetgum trees in the valley
    give off a faint, distinctive scent that attracts moths and butterflies, creating
    an exceptional biotope.

- text: The natural beauty of the landscape, combined with the delightful presence
    of thousands of butterflies, brings in hordes of local and foreign tourists to
    the valley every summer. Unfortunately, the population of butterflies is depleting
    progressively since they don’t have a stomach and can’t feed to gain energy. When
    disturbed due to human activities, they fly more frequently, which causes excessive
    energy loss. This is one of the leading reasons behind the decreasing population
    of butterflies in the region.

- text: "A few decades ago, a German entomologist, studied the butterflies that emerge
    in the Butterfly Valley during June and September. This particular species of
    butterflies is called Callimorpha Qudripunctaria Himalaiensis. The remarkable
    name befits the species since it was first discovered in the great mountains of
    Himalayas. These butterflies are abundantly found in Australia, Brazil, Peru,
    California, and many other places where the native plants include the Liquidambar
    Orientalis trees.\n\nThe butterflies appear in the valley during the summer season.
    They mate, lay eggs on the island, and fly off in September once the temperature
    starts to change. The eggs produce larva in April. By the next month, the larvae
    transform into chrysalises. The transformation finally completes in early June
    as chrysalises transform into adult butterflies. As the temperature starts to
    rise, these beautiful butterflies leave their locale and travel through the night
    to reach the valley. The moderately cool temperature of the valley and its surrounding
    areas, coupled with the sweet scent of raisins, is the reason behind this mass
    migration.               "
