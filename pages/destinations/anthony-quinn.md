    Located on the eastern coast of Rhodes, this beach is famous as the filming spot of the classic movie ‘The Guns of Navaronne’ which starred Anthony Quinn. The reason why the beach was named after him involves an interesting story. The actor bought the isolated bay and was planning to create a center for artists and filmmakers there.

    Even though he lost the purchase because of the government later on, the beach is still known by the actor’s name. Offering stunning scenery, it is a ripe spot for tourists and families alike. A stairway leads down to it and even though it is littered with pebbles and rocks at certain points, you can always lounge on the sun beds and feel comfortable.

- text: Other services you can avail at the beach include a cafe and umbrella rentals
    if you just want to read on the beach and not sunbathe. Ideal for diving and snorkeling.
    The spot does get quite crowded in the summer with tourists, so if you want quite
    time there, you can visit year-round except in July and August.
