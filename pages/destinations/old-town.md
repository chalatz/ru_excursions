  text: The most beautiful part of the old town is the so called **"Street of the
    Knights"**. Is a set-piece Italian restoration of the enclave created by the Knights
    of St John as their main thoroughfare. Several Langues had their palaces along
    the street. The street links the **"Hospital of the Knights"** now houses the
    "Archeological Museum of Rhodes" to the **"Palace of the Grand Masters"** now
    houses a museum.
