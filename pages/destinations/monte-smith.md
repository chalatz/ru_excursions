- text: Also known as Agios Stefanos hill and Saint Stephen hill, Monte Smith hill
    was named after Sir Sydney Smith. He was an English admiral who was stationed
    on the hill in 1802 during the war with Turks to monitor the movements of Napoleon’s
    fleet.   The acropolis of ancient Rhodes was a colossal area with multiple sanctuaries,
    public building, monumental temples, and even underground cult areas. These structures
    date back to the 2nd and 3rd century BC. It won’t be a stretch to say that the
    current findings represent only a fraction of the magnificent history of the glorious
    past of Rhodes.   One of the best places to admire the relics of past in Rhodes
    is the acropolis of Rhodes. Situated at a distance of about 3Km from the center
    of the city, the acropolis is an extremely intriguing archaeological site. Moreover,
    the excursion offers extraordinary views of the pristine beauty of the surrounding
    area.
- title: Temple of Pythian Apollo and the Odeion (Classical Theater)
  text: "**The temple of Pythian Apollo** is a majestic structure on the west side
    of the terrace. It is located on the southern part of the hill. While the temple
    is smaller than those of Athena and Zeus, which are located on the northern edge
    of the acropolis, it was a poros peripteral temple. Out of the remaining structure,
    part of the architrave and some part on the northeast side have been restored.\n\n**The
    Odeion** situated below the site of the temple, Oedion was a small theatre with
    around 800 seats. Today, only a few seats and the orchestra remain of the original
    structure. It is speculated that the areas were used by for affairs of the Apollo
    cult and the Rhodian School of Rhetoric. It is believed that another theatre,
    which was much larger in size, was also situated on the same grounds around the
    hill. According to an inscription found in the area, a huge library was also sited
    near the Odeion and the gymnasium. "

- title: Rhodes Ancient Stadium and the Gymnasium
  text: |-
    Situated on the south-east side of the hill, the **ancient stadium of Rhodes** was a 210-meter long stadion. Grand athletic competitions were conducted in it as a part of the famous Haleion Games. These games marked an important celebration that was held to honor the god of the sun, Halios. The stadium was excavated and restored by Italians. They preserved the starting mechanism that was used in ancient times for athletes, along with the sphendone and some of the lower seats in the auditorium.

    **The gymnasium** is located to the east of the stadium. It was a huge building, which was square in shape and measured around 200m on each side. It was valued due to the pieces of art that it contained. Till date, only the west side and northeast corners have been discovered.
