- text: Located at a distance 32 km from Rhodes Town, Ancient Kamiros was one of the
    three most important cities on the island before Rhodes was founded in 408 BC.
    The region was inhabited as early as the Mycenaean era. However, once Rhodes was
    developed, Kamiros lost its significance and finally vanished for good in the
    2nd century BC. The city was built over the ruins of an older settlement, which
    was destroyed in an earthquake in 226BC. Divided into different zones of public
    and private buildings, the city is the perfect example of Hellenistic urban layout
    and designs.

  text: "**Temple of Athena Kameiras:** With porticos on all sides, the magnificent
    temple of Athena was surrounded by peribolos. Like most of the city, it was also
    built over the foundation of another temple that was destroyed in the earthquake
    in 226 BC. \n\n**Archaic Cistern:** Rectangular in shape and lined with plaster,
    Archaic Cistern was the reservoir that served water to the city via terra-cotta
    pipes and apertures. With a capacity of 600,000 litres, the reservoir could easily
    hold water for around 400 families. Steps were built on the side to provide access
    inside the reservoir for cleaning. During the Hellenistic period, it was replaced
    by a Stoa.\n\n**Hellenistic Stoa:** The Stoa was built in the shape of the Greek
    letter Î . It was 200 meters long and had two rows of Doric columns. An extraordinary,
    underground water supply system with terra-cotta water pipes, subterranean tanks,
    and wells replaced the Archaic Cistern effectively."

  text: The settlement was built during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. It was
    built according to the Hippodamian system, which means it was a grid of residential
    blocks and streets of the same size. One of the distinctive features of the residential
    quarters was the interior colonnaded courtyard, which was generally higher on
    one side than the other. They were decorated with mosaic floors and painted adornments
    on plaster. Facades with architraves were also used for decoration purposes.

  text: "**Doric Temple:** The temple was located on the third terrace of the archaeological
    zone. It stood on the north-western edge of the Fountain Square. It was a poros
    distyle temple, which means that along with cella, pronaos, and opisthodomos,
    it had antis in the front and had two columns. It is speculated that the temple
    was dedicated to Pythian Apollo.  \n\n**Fountain Square:** The Fountain Square
    was located to the east of the Doric Temple. It was a big, rectangular area with
    numerous votive bases that were inscribed. It also consisted of six Doric columns
    that supported an entablature. An open cistern was always present from which water
    was drawn during the mid 4th century. The cistern was later replaced by a well.
    \n\n**Hellenistic Sanctuary:** The sanctuary was dedicated to the gods and heroes
    of Kamiros. It was located opposite the Fountain Square and featured altars inside
    the enclosure. It is speculated that this was the Hierothyteion of Kamiros."

- text: It must be noted that Kamiros is often compared with Pompei. However, the
    comparison is unjustified as, unlike Pompie, Kamiros did not fall due to a natural
    disaster. The city was slowly abandoned once Rhodes was developed.
