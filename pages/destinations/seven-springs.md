    of Rhodes prettiest little secrets. It is easy to access from the East Coast and
    is situated at 27 km (16 miles) from the Town of Rhodes. This destination looks
    like a slice of paradise and offers visitors a refuge from the hot weather.   At
    first glance, people might assume that it’s just a valley, but Seven Springs is
    full of clear, cool springs that are shaded with enormous pine trees. The nearby
    forests have walking trails and walk here is a recommended activity for all. The
    natural scenery of the place not only attracts visitors, but it is also common
    to see peacocks and ducks cooling in the springs.

- text: Seven Springs has a stunning landscape that is naturally cool, even during
    the heavy heat that comes in high summer. The area is completely swamped and surrounded
    by lush greenery that also adds a magical aura to the place. The water from the
    springs is plentiful at all times of the year.  It overflows into an artificial
    lake that is now the natural habitat of local crabs, eels, tortoises and the rare
    gizani – a fish species that is indigenous to Rhodes. Visitors will find that
    the views here are stunning and just as picturesque as the rest of the area. Here
    the visitors can also enjoy a swim at seven springs.

- text: Since the lake is man-made, there is a path that leads from the springs down
    to it. You can walk through a tunnel, but it is narrow and dark. The tunnel extends
    for 186 m and can take only five minutes to finish. However, it is recommended
    that you carry a torch as there are some curves in the path that can be hard to
    see in the dark.   The tunnel is also part of the history of the Seven Springs.
    It was created in 1931 by Italians. The most unique part about it is that it was
    designed for use by one person only. Due to this, it’s largely a one-way tunnel
    only.  In the middle of the tunnel, there is an emergency exit as well as an air
    shaft. There is a ladder here which leads to the street above. This street has
    a walking track which can also be used to get to the tunnel and come back from
    it.
