- text: Filerimos Mountain located just out of Rhodes Town about 14 km / 8 miles on
    the west coast of the island.  This place is an important archaeological site,
    here once stood the Acropolis of the Ancient Ialyssos with an important temple
    dedicated to Athena Polias.
- title: The Church of "Our Lady of Filerimos"
  text: The hill took its name from a monk who came from Jerusalem in the 13th century
    bringing with him an icon of the Blessed Virgin painted by the Apostle Luke. The
    small church he built later became a basilica and then in the 14th century under
    the rule of the Knights of St. John a Monastery was built, surrounded by cloisters
    and cells and a number of chapels. There is where the miracle-working icon is
    so reverently kept. When the island came into the possession of the Ottoman Turks,
    the icon was taken by the Knights to France and from there to Italy , then Malta
    and Russia , where it stayed until the 1917 revolution. Since 2002, it has been
    kept in the Blue Chapel of the National Museum of Montenegro and a copy has been
    put in its place.

- title: The Monastery
  text: The monastery was destroyed during the Turkish occupation. The Italians rebuilt
    the monastery during their occupation and kept it open with monks from the Capuchin
    Order. During the 2nd world war the monks returned to Italy and since then the
    monastery has been closed.

- title: Via Dolorosa and the Cross
  text: |-
    The Italians also added a Via Crucis (Calvary), a pathway that leads from the monastery towards the south-western edge of the plateau, to a small square with a stunning view. Here an imposing iron Cross stood in the middle. (Today it's a concrete Cross) Along the right side of the path, stone altars were built with embedded reliefs, depicting scenes of the Passions of Jesus.

    The Via Dolorosa is the journey undertaken by Jesus, starting at the place where Pilate sentenced him to death and ending on **Mount Golgotha** (Calvary) and is also known as the **Way of the Cross** or the **Via Crucis**. Jesus walks this distance carrying the cross upon which he will be crucified.
