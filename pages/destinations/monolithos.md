- title: Monolithos Village
  text: No trip to Rhodes is complete without a visit to the Monolithos village and
    castle. The picturesque village of Monolithos has about 250 inhabitants and is
    located about 45 miles, 72 km southwest of Rhodes. Its name is derived from the
    large monolithic rock that serves as the foundation for the castle which has been
    there since the classical times.
- title: Monolithos Castle
  text: The magnificent castle offers panoramic views of Monolithos. The castle used
    to be an Ancient Phryctoria which was used to transmit messages from one hill
    to another. In the late 1400s, the castle was made using pedestals that were bestowed
    by the Knights of St. John. The main reason for the construction of the castle
    was to provide residents a clear vantage point that revealed the whole southern
    part of the island. That way, they could see pirates coming from miles away and
    the villagers could evacuate in time.

  footer_text: According to the 1479 decree, the people of Apolakkia village had to
    seek refuge in the castle in case of an attack. Due to its ideal location on top
    of the rock, it served as a perfect natural fortification against enemies. This
    is why the castle is considered to be one of the four main strong fortresses on
    the island. It has also remained largely unaltered over the years, so when you
    visit the castle, you will feel as if you stepped back in time. While historical
    records about the castle are quite brief, we do know that it probably fell into
    the hands of the Turks after the knights left in 1522. Plus, when piracy nearly
    disappeared during the 17th Century, the castle fell into disuse and was eventually
    abandoned.

  footer_text: 'Construction on the castle started in 1476 and ended in 1503 under
    the supervision of Grand Master Pierre D’ Aubusson. While it was a fortress to
    be reckoned with back in the day, today, only a few of its walls remain. However,
    the chaple of St. Panteleimon is quite well-preserved to this day along with the
    remains of a chapel that was made to honor St. George. '
- title: The Views
  text: You need to trek for a bit to reach the castle on top of the rock. Just follow
    the path in the woods and it will lead you to stairs that are carved into the
    rock. The stairs are slippery though, so make sure you wear hiking shoes during
    the trek. Once you reach the top, you will forget your stress and fatigue completely.
    The word ‘breathtaking’ doesn’t even do it justice. The view from the cliffs includes
    a pine forest that stretched for miles and below, you can spot the Halki and Alimia
    islands right on the sparkling blue Aegean Sea.
