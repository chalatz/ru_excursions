    (or Tsampika Beach) is located on the eastern coast just 26km (17miles) from Rhodes
    town. The name was derived from the name of a small monastery called the Virgin
    of Tsambika, which lies 340 meters up a hill. You should visit the place, especially
    if you want to see a panoramic view of the bay.  Tsambika looks like it was taken
    straight from a postcard. The pristine beach stretches over 800 meters, it boasts
    fine golden sand and only a few stones so you can go barefoot. The water is crystal
    clear so you will have an unforgettable swimming experience.
