    The village of Lindos is located on the southeast side of the island and it is well-known not only for its ideal location, but also its beaches:

    **Megali Paralia** – The name Megali Paralia means ‘big beach’ and it is just walking distance from Lindos village. It is also the largest beach on the island.

    **Lindos Palla**s – This is the perfect beach to visit if you want to arrange a private picnic for two. Lindos Pallas is a peaceful and small beach compared to Megali Paralia.

    Whether you visit Paralia or Pallas, you will be treated with golden sands and crystal-clear water. Visitors can lounge besides the beach on comfortable sun beds and when they feel puckish, they can head to one of the restaurants. Fancy a dip in the clear water? Bring your bathing suit and change into it in one of the many changing rooms before taking the plunge.

  footer_text: Be careful when you are heading to either beach though. The path that
    originates from the village is quite steep, so make sure you have sturdy shoes
    on. However, once you get to your destination, you can let loose, change into
    swimwear, lose the shoes, and just have fun with your family. The best thing about
    the beach is that it is well-protected from Mother Nature because of the rocky
    peninsula. So, you can enjoy jet skiing or ride a banana boat out on the water
    without fear.
