    be on your bucket list. Embona or Empona is located on the west coast of the island,
    about 32 miles from Rhodes town, the tiny village is known not only for the wine
    it makes, but also for its unique location. It is nestled under the highest mountain
    on the island called Attaviros and is filled with luscious olive groves, vineyards,
    and pine forests. The top of the mountain still has remains of a temple that was
    built to pay homage to the Greek God Zeus.
