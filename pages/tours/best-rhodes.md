- The **North Point of the island** where the East Coast's Mediterranean Sea, and the West Coast's Aegean Sea meet.

### MONTE SMITH

We drive up the hillside to **Monte Smith**, (although named after a 19th century British admiral, this is the site of ancient Rhodes) the **Acropolis of Rhodes City** which overlooks the Old and the New Town. Enjoy excellent views of the city and both East and West Coast. (Stop Visit Photos). We also visit the **Temple of Apollo**, the **Ancient Stadium of Rhodes**, and the restored marble **Hellenistic Theater**. (Stop Visit Photos)

### THE JOURNEY TO LINDOS

### ANTHONY QUINN BAY

On the way you visit the Anthony Quinn Bay - Takes its name from the famous Hollywood actor, who owns a large property in this area. Since filming the Guns of Navarone in Rhodes Island - scenic (Stop Visit Photos). We continue south east to Lindos, a short stop at a vantage point for the panoramic view of Tsambica beach - scenic (Stop Photos)

### RHODES TRADITIONAL POTTERY ART

On the way to Lindos, you can choose an optional short stop at a pottery workshop where the traditional pottery of Rhodes is made. You can even learn the mystery of the Pythagorean cup. Just let your tour/driver know that you wish to make this short stop.

### PANORAMIC VIEW OF LINDOS

One mile before Lindos we stop at a vantage point for a panoramic view of the acropolis, the village, and the port of Lindos. (Stop Photos)

### ST PAUL'S BAY

### LINDOS VILLAGE AND ACROPOLIS

Then we drive you to the **main square of Lindos village**, so you can explore the white village and climb up the **Acropolis of Lindos**, (passing colorful storefronts and whitewashed elaborately decorated homes) to see the magnificent remains of past civilizations: the **4th century BC Doric Temple of Athena Lindia**, **a double-winged portico**, **a Byzantine church and the fortifications of the Knights of St John**.

Don't want to walk? Take a "Lindos Taxi"---a donkey! The vantage point from the Acropolis affords you breath-taking views of a great expanse of the Mediterranean Sea, the St. Paul's Bay, and the white village of Lindos. (Stop Visit Photos)
