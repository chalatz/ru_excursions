  title: Useful Info
  text: |-
    1. Even if you aren't big wine connoisseurs you can taste any type of wine you wish. You don't have to purchase any amount of wine; also, you can get detailed info on every winery from the wine makers while you taste the wines.
    2. It is a historical fact that the island of Rhodes was one of the most important wine production and trade areas in the ancient world. The landscape, the fertile earth and the combination of a mild climate, the unique sun and low rainfall are perfect climatic conditions, which are so important to produce the local grape varieties.
    3. Rhodes Island known for its three wine labels:<br>
    A) White wine from the white grape variety **Athiri** (VDQS), a classic Aegean variety cultivated in the wider area since antiquity.<br>
    B) Red wine (VDQS) from a red grape variety which has come to dominate almost all islands of the Aegean. **Mandilaria** (often also called **Amorgiano**).<br>
    C) Sweet white wine (VDQS) produced by blending two varieties of **Muscat grapes**. Classic **white Muscat** (from Samos) and the Italian imported **Trani Muscat**.
    4. You may prefer to use ATM machines when you need cash. ATMs are everywhere.
    5. Rhodes known for [Traditional Appetizers](rhodes_cuisine_greece.htm), desserts, [Wines](wine_tours_greece.htm), the famous handmade [Rhodes Pottery - Ceramics](keramika-rodosa-gretsiya.htm) and the beautiful [Rhodes Beaches](./rhodes-beach-tour-excursion.htm).
