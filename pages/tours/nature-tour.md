### KALLITHEA SPA

The tour begins at the Kallithea Spa (Springs), which is located on the East Coast of the island. We will drive you to this spa from your selected pickup location. The Kallithea Spa dates back to the Classical Antiquity times. Ever since its renovation, the majestic monument has gained popularity as a tourist spot and wedding destination.   The mesmerizing place even captured the attention of Hollywood directors. Various Greek and international productions, including *"Escape to Athena,"* starring Roger Moore and Telly Savalas, are filmed here. Kallithea Spa can also be seen in a few scenes from "*The Guns of Navarone."*

### ANTHONY QUINN BAY

With scenic views and clear blue waters, our next destination -- Anthony Quinn Bay -- will take your breath away. It is named after the Hollywood star, Anthony Quinn. Anthony liked Greece so much that after shooting one of his greatest films, "The Guns of Navarone," in Rhodes Island, he decided to buy a property in the area .

### RHODIAN TRADITIONAL ART

If you are interested in learning about the culture of Rhodes, you can choose to make a short stop at the traditional pottery workshop on your way. Traditional Rhodes pottery is made and displayed here. You can check out the beautiful pieces of pottery and watch the potters at work. The potter may even share the mystery of the Pythagorean Cup with you! If traditional Rhodes pottery interests you, make sure you tell your driver to make this stop.

### SEVEN SPRINGS

The next destination of the Rhodes Island nature tour is Seven Springs. Located in the southeast, this charming valley is dotted with clear water springs. With high pine trees and humongous planes, it is a serene place that will bring you closer to nature. In the summer heat, Seven Springs acts as a blissful oasis with beautiful bridges, streams, fields of flowers, ducks, peacocks, and much more!

### A scenic drive from the East to the West Coast of the Island 

The tour takes us through the pines and cypress forests to the West Coast, you can take in the breath-taking views of the Aegean Sea.

### VALLEY OF THE BUTTERFLIES

The Valley of the butterflies is one of the most charming stops of our Rhodes Island nature tour. You will be dropped at the upper gate. From here, you will take a serene walk down the valley and marvel at the wonder of thousands of butterflies congregating in their natural habitat. This phenomenon takes place from mid-June to mid-September. You will witness delicate butterflies as they camouflage in the trees. The valley is dotted with natural paths and wooden bridges that will guide you on the walk down the valley.

### FILERIMOS MOUNTAIN

After this wonderful experience, we will continue the exciting journey on the coastal road of Kremasti village and Lalysos town until we reach our next stop, the Filerimos Mountain. With an altitude of around 267 meters (876 feet), the mountain offers some spectacular views. We will drive you to the top of the hill where you can experience the ruins of the Acropolis of the Ancient Lalyssos and the church of Our Lady of Filerimos. The foundation of this iconic church is the temple of Athena, which dates back to the early Christian era. You will also get to view the exterior of the barrel-vaulted Chapel of St. George and Filerimos Monastery.

### FILERIMOS - THE WAY OF THE CROSS

The Way of the Cross is a beautiful path that wounds around the trees on the Filerimos Mountain. It displays shrines that depict the relief scene of the Passion. The Way of the Cross will take you through the main square to the west edge of the plateau where the huge, 16-meter (48 feet) cross looks over the west coast. While you marvel at the gigantic cross, you can also enjoy breathtaking views!

### BACK TO THE SHIP (OR TO THE STARTING POINT)

We travel back along the West Coast, with its breath-taking views of the Aegean Sea, to your cruise ship. If you prefer to be taken to the Medieval City for independent browsing, you will be responsible for returning on foot to the ship, docked about a quarter-mile away.
