### RHODES NEW TOWN

From the cruise ship dock/pier or your chosen point, you'll be driven to the antique harbor, where according to tradition, the **Colossus of Rhodes**, **one of the seven wonders of the ancient world**, once stood. (Stop Visit Photos)\
The **North Point of the island** where the East Coast's Mediterranean Sea, and the West Coast's Aegean Sea meet.

### MONTE SMITH - PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE CITY

Continuing up the hillside to **Monte Smith**, the **Acropolis of Rhodes City**, you will enjoy excellent views of the new and old town of Rhodes and be able to take pictures. (Stop Visit Photos)

### MONTE SMITH - TEMPLE - STADIUM - THEATRE

Then we drive to the **Temple of Apollo**, the restored **Greek Stadium**, and the **Greek Theatre**. While you take pictures, your kids can run into the Old Stadium and feel the Ancient Greek athletic spirit. (Stop Visit Photos)

### RHODES OSTRICH FARM & ZOO PARK

Then your journey to the **"Rhodes Ostrich Farm"** and **Zoo Park** will take you along a beautiful, 20 kilometers / 14 miles drive on the **west coast of the island**.

This animal farm will delight both young and old. Here you'll have the opportunity to get a closer look at over 120 ostriches living within a purely natural environment. The park is home to other kinds of rare animals as well. (Stop Visit Photos)

### VALLEY OF THE BUTTERFLIES

We continue our drive to the **Valley of the Butterflies**. This site is beautifully arranged with wooden bridges, and from mid-June to mid-September, thousands of multi-colored butterflies appear. An excellent place for families with children, who wish to enjoy the beauties of nature and examine the life cycle of butterflies as part of their summer holiday. We drive you to the upper gate, so that you may more easily explore the valley. You and your children will love the peaceful walk through the shaded, green valley with its small river and beautiful waterfalls. If you are quiet and still, they may even land on your arm that would make a wonderful photo! (Stop Visit Photos)

### BEE MUSEUM

Next stop is the **"Bee Museum"** Here you can see the life circle of the bees and their caste system in transparent hives and learn everything about the honey. You can have a free honey tasting and the "melekounia" (traditional snack) They also have different types of honey products as cosmetics

### BACK TO THE SHIP (or to the STARTING POINT)

In case you wish to extend the tour you may prefer to drive back through the east coast. If you prefer to be taken to the Medieval City for independent browsing, you will be responsible for returning on foot to the ship, docked about a quarter-mile away.
